<p style="font-size:30px;">There aren’t any good relationships in this book.  Even though Cicada is a kind and caring creature the other people in the company are really mean.  Because of this they all have bad relationships with each other.  I think that the author did this because he wants the idea of bullying to come through.  I think That it’s a great idea.
