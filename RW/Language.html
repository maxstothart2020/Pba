<p style="font-size:30px;">The author uses very simple sentences.  All the writing is small and centered in a white page.   and repeatedly uses the words Tok Tok Tok.  I think Tok Tok Tok means the ticking sound you make when your disagreeing with someone/thing because Cicada is a Cicada he can’t make the click like we can.  It was also the author’s favourite band.  No page has more than 4 lines of text.  I think this is because the author wants the story to come from the perspective of Cicada.</p>
