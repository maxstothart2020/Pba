<p style="color:Orange;">The author is Shaun Tan.  The book was published by Hachette Australia in 2018.  The main character is a called Cicada.  Cicada is a cicada that has worked for seventeen years and lives in office wallspace, no one likes Cicada.  Cicada is kind and caring but is treated with nastiness and cruelty.  I chose this book because It has a great plot and the language is rich and unique.
