<p style="font-size:30px;">The story ideas are based on bullying.  I think that the book is based on some key concepts that we need in life.  This author is very clever because he’s made an awesome book showcasing our civilisation’s biggest problem.  BULLYING!  Bullying is when someone is mean to someone.  Bullying normally happens because someone is different to other people.
(e.g. Seventeen year no promotion.  Human resources say Cicada not human!  Need no resources. Tok Tok Tok.)
